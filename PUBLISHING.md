## üöÄ Step-by-Step Publishing

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it: `bsky-affirmative-bot`
3. Description: "Enhanced English-first Bluesky bot with ultra-fast responses, deep user profiling, and OpenRouter integration"
4. Choose: **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Update Repository URLs

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in these files with your actual GitHub username:

**Files to update:**
- `README.md` (multiple locations)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (GitHub links)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (repository links)
- `QUICKSTART.md` (clone URL)
- `package.json` (repository, bugs, homepage URLs)

Quick find and replace:
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username
find . -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "package.json" \) -exec sed -i 's/YOUR_USERNAME/your-actual-username/g' {} +
```

### Step 3: Initialize Git (if not already)

```bash
# If this is a fresh fork, initialize git
cd bsky-affirmative-bot

# Check if git is already initialized
git status

# If not initialized:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Enhanced fork with English-first support"
```

### Step 4: Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Add your new GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bsky-affirmative-bot.git

# If you already have a remote named 'origin', rename it first:
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bsky-affirmative-bot.git
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 6: Configure GitHub Repository

On GitHub, go to your repository settings:

#### Topics (for discoverability)
Add these topics: `bluesky`, `atproto`, `bot`, `ai`, `chatbot`, `openrouter`, `gemini`, `typescript`, `nodejs`

#### About Section
- **Description**: "Enhanced Bluesky bot with ultra-fast responses, deep user profiling, OpenRouter integration, and custom PDS support"
- **Website**: (your bot's Bluesky profile URL if you have one)
- ‚úÖ Check "Issues"
- ‚úÖ Check "Discussions"

#### Issues Template (optional but recommended)

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Bug Report
about: Report a bug or issue
title: '[BUG] '
labels: bug
---

**Describe the bug**
A clear description of what the bug is.

## üîó Linking to Original Repository

### Mark as Fork on GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"** (bottom)
4. Look for "This repository is not a fork"
5. If you want GitHub to recognize it as a fork, contact GitHub Support to link it to `suibari/bsky-affirmative-bot`

**Or simply mention it prominently in your README** (already done!).

### Give Credit to Original Author

Make sure these are visible in your repo:

1. **README.md**: Credits section linking to original
2. **CHANGELOG.md**: Original version history
3. **package.json**: `contributors` field includes original author
4. **GitHub Topics**: Include `fork` tag

# Check for accidentally committed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# Check for API keys in commits

# If you find secrets, clean history (CAREFUL!):
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### After Publishing
